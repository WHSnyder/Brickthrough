# GeometricML

Repo containing small ML projects for testing different ideas.  I'm interested in ML in 3D contexts and using CNN based architectures to infer pose from images of known primitives.

A good starting point would be determining pose from low resolution renders of Lego pieces from Blender.  That's what all these Python scripts do now (classification, rotation estimation), although the ultimate goal is to implement/train <a href = "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.00199.pdf">PoseCNN</a> to infer the 3D poses of all Lego pieces in a combination.  My effete MacBook Pro is no match for this task but with a proper PC I think it should be doable.
